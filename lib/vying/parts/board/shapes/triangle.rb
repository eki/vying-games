  prototype

  # Initializes a triangle shaped board.
  #
  # NOTE:  You don't have to call Board::Triangle.new directly, you can use
  #        the convenience method Board.triangle.
  #
  # Requires a length for each side of the board.  In addition to the options
  # provided by Board, you may provide:
  #
  #   :cell_shape  -  Valid values include [:hexagon].  In the future :triangle
  #                   might be added.  The default is :hexagon.
  #
  #   :cell_orientation - Valid values include [:horizontal, :vertical].
  #                       This is used to set the connectivity directions for
  #                       :hexagon cells.  The default is :vertical.
