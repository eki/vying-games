# Pah-Tum, sometimes written as POTM, provides an interesting twist on
# n-in-a-row games.  Instead of the game ending when a player achieves
# n-in-a-row, the game continues until the board is full, longer strings
# of pieces are worth more points and the winner is the player with the
# highest score at the end of the game.  The game also features random
# initial positions.
#
# For detailed rules see:  http://vying.org/games/pah_tum
